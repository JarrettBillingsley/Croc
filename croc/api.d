/**
Initialize a VM instance. This is independent from all other VM instances. It performs its
own garbage collection, and as far as I know, multiple OS threads can each have their own
VM and manipulate them at the same time without consequence. (The library has not, however,
been designed with multithreading in mind, so you will have to synchronize access to a single
VM from multiple threads.)

This call also allocates an instance of tango.text.convert.Layout on the D heap, so that the
library can perform formatting without allocating memory later.

Params:
	vm = The VM object to initialize. $(B This object must have been allocated somewhere in D
		memory) (either on the stack or with 'new'). If it's not in D's memory, you must inform
		the D GC of its existence, or else D will blindly collect objects that the Croc VM
		references.
	memFunc = The memory allocation function to use to allocate this VM. The VM's allocation
		function will be set to this after creation. Defaults to DefaultMemFunc, which uses
		the C allocator.
	ctx = An opaque context pointer that will be passed to the memory function at each call.
		The Croc library does not do anything with this pointer other than store it. Note that
		since it is stored in the VM structure, it can safely point into D heap memory.

Returns:
	The newly-opened VM's main thread.

/**
Closes a VM object and deallocates all memory associated with it. This also runs finalizers on all
remaining finalizable objects. Finalization is guaranteed so that long-running processes can create
and destroy VMs without having to worry about Croc code never releasing system resources like file
handles. Of course, if there is an error in a finalizer, the finalization process will be halted and
the VM will be in an unclosable state. This is why making finalizers not fail is important.

Params:
	vm = The VM to free. After all memory has been freed, the memory at this pointer will be initialized
		to an "empty" or "dead" VM which can then be passed into openVM.
