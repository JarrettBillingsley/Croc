The Croc :crocodile: Programming Language
=============================

What's Croc?
------------

Croc is a small, dynamically-typed language most closely related to Lua, with C-style syntax. Its semantics are borrowed mainly from Lua, D, Squirrel, and Io,
though many other languages served as inspirations.

# It's not developed anymore. No one ever used it. But I still love it :pensive:
