The Newt Programming Language
=============================

What's Newt?
------------

Newt is a small, dynamically-typed language most closely related to Lua, with C-style syntax. Its semantics are borrowed mainly from Lua, D, Squirrel, and Io,
though many other languages served as inspirations. It aims to be somewhat unique among dynamically-typed languages by making it as difficult as possible for
you, the programmer, to make mistakes. It also tries to be fast and to make memory allocation the exception rather than the norm. Lastly, it is meant to be a
language that is perfectly capable on its own, but which can be seamlessly integrated into and/or extended by a host language.

It used to be called [MiniD](http://www.dsource.org/projects/minid/).

It was conceived, written, and is maintained by Jarrett Billingsley.
