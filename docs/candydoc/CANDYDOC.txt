How to use:
    1) Put 'candydoc' directory in place where documentation will be.
    2) Modify modules.ddoc file: enumerate all modules that should be avaible
       for navigation.
    3) Modify style.css file if you want to change style of documentation. Or
       leave it unmodified to apply defaul theme.
    4) Run documentation compilation with candy.ddoc and modules.ddoc specified
       on command line.
    5) Enjoy a result :)

Known bugs:
    - Explorer window doesn't work on Safari browser.
    - Scroll bar positions are not adjusted after explorer's tab change in Opera
      browser. So it is posible to see nothing on some tab: solution is to
      return to a previous tab, scroll it to top and then return back.
    - Overlapping of some elements when too few horizontal place avaible.
